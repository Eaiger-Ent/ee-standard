"""The states a deployment can be in, held apart from each other.

Phase 5's first two exit criteria are one sentence in two halves — *bumping a
gate's version without changing its output produces no redeployment
recommendation*, and *bumping its contract version does* — and they are the
whole noise argument. A mechanism that fires on every release is ignored within
a month; one that fires on nothing is invisible.

They are tested here rather than demonstrated against this repository, because
on the day ADR 0038 landed every gate here reports the same state
(`UNRECORDED`), and a report whose every row agrees is no evidence that the rows
can differ. Each state below is built from a fixture that differs from the next
in exactly the field that is supposed to decide it.
